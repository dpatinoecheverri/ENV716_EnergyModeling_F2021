# Lab 12 - Simulation Random Variables in Python

Learning goals:

* Get familiar with library random and how to set the seed for random number generation;
* Simulate a coin flip and roll a die using random.randint();
* Simulate a coin flip using np.random and the binomial distribution;
* Get familiar with the library scipy.stats and its functios rvs(), cdf() and pdf() using the binomial and the continuous uniform distribution.

If you are using Colab to open the notebook go to "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb". Select File > Open Notebook. 
In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "lmmlima/ENV716_EnergyModeling_F2021". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. Choose the "Lab12/Lab12_SimulatingRandomVariables.ipynb". 
**Save a copy to your drive.** You can now run and make any changes to this file and the modified notebook can be found in your "Colab Notebooks" folder.
