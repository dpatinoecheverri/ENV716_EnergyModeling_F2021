# Lab 12 - Simulation Random Variables in Python

Learning goals:

* Get familiar with library random and how to set the seed for random number generation;
* Simulate a coin flip and roll a die using random.randint();
* Simulate a coin flip using np.random and the binomial distribution;
* Get familiar with the library scipy.stats and its functios rvs(), cdf() and pdf() using the binomial and the continuous uniform distribution.
