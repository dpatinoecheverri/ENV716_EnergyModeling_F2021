# Lab 4 - UDFs and dictionaries in Python

Learning goals:

1. Learn how to create and call user defined functions
2. Learn how to create dictionaries in Python to improve your UDF. 


Below you will find two videos. The first is showing how to create a temperature converter UDF (same example from lecture) with details abotu syntax and arguments.
The second shows how to create a dictionary to improve the temparature converter UDF. The dictionary will associate all the possible ways the user can spell out the temperature unit with a a pre-specified string that the function can recognize. 

To open the notebook on Colab go to "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb". Select File > Open Notebook. 
In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "lmmlima/ENV716_EnergyModeling_F2021". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. Choose the "Lab4/Lab3_Pivot_Tables.ipynb". 
**Save a copy to your drive.** You can now run and make any changes to this file and teh modified notebook can be found in your "Colab Notebooks" folder.
