If you are using Colab to open the notebook go to "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb". Select File > Open Notebook. 
In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "lmmlima/ENV716_EnergyModeling_F2021". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. Choose the "Lab7/Lab7_MoreonLPs.ipynb". 
**Save a copy to your drive.** You can now run and make any changes to this file and the modified notebook can be found in your "Colab Notebooks" folder.
