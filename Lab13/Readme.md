# Lab 13 - Monte Carlo Part 2: Fitting Distribution to Data in Python

Learning goals:

* Get familiar with the library scipy.stats and its functios *.fit()*;
* Understand how to use the parameters estimated on the *.fit()* to calculate values for theoretical cdf and pdf;
* Get familiar with *np.linspace()*;
* Get familiar with matplotlib.pyplot and how to plot more than one series in the same graph.

If you are using Colab to open the notebook go to "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb". Select File > Open Notebook. 
In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "lmmlima/ENV716_EnergyModeling_F2021". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. Choose the "Lab13/Lab13_SimulatingRandomVariables.ipynb". 
**Save a copy to your drive.** You can now run and make any changes to this file and the modified notebook can be found in your "Colab Notebooks" folder.
