# Lab 2 - Reading Data Sets in Python

Learning goals: 
* How to read excel spreadsheets in Python;
* How to slice you large data set into a smaller data set;
* How to filter rows and columns;
* How to get summary values.

This Lab will teach you how to import and manipulate e-grid with Python. 

Go to "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb". Select File > Open Notebook. In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "lmmlima/ENV716_EnergyModeling_F2021". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. Choose the "Lab2/Lab2_Exploring_egrid.ipynb". You can now run and make any changes to this file. Make sure you save the file and any changes to your google drive before closing it. 

Make sure you have a copy of the e-grid 2019 file on you drive before you run the code.
