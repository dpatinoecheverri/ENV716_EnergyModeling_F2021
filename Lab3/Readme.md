# Lab 3 - More on filtering data sets and Pivot Tables in Python

Learning goals: 
* Learn how to change column type from character to float/int;
* Learn how to create pivot tables from a data frame using function pivot_table();
* Learn how to save your table as an excel file.

Go to "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb". Select File > Open Notebook. In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "lmmlima/ENV716_EnergyModeling_F2021". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. Choose the "Lab3/Lab3_Pivot_Tables.ipynb". You can now run and make any changes to this file. Make sure you save the file and any changes to your google drive before closing it. 

Make sure you have a copy of the e-grid 2019 file on you drive/current directory before you run the code.
