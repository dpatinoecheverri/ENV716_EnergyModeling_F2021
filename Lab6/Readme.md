# Lab 6 - More on LPs in Python

Learning goals:

1) Learn how to implement a simple LP using numpy arrays;
2) Learn how to implement a simple LP using object Sets() and Param();
3) Learn how to use dictionaries and UDFs in Pyomo to facilitate model implementation.

If you are using Colab to open the notebook go to "https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb". Select File > Open Notebook. 
In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "lmmlima/ENV716_EnergyModeling_F2021". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. Choose the "Lab6/Lab6_MoreonLPs.ipynb". 
**Save a copy to your drive.** You can now run and make any changes to this file and the modified notebook can be found in your "Colab Notebooks" folder.
