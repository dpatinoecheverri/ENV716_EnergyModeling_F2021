# Lab 1 - Python 101 | Install procedure | Installing PANDAS library | Simple code

Please follow the instructions on the Python 101 file and make sure everything is running on your computer. 
There are two Python 101 files, one for Mac users and one for PC users.

Once Python is up and running and you got your "Hello World" message, you are ready to run your first .ipynb script. In this first script you will learn how to make simple math operations, create variables and lists in Python.

Available recordings:

This year you will be given an option to use Google Colab. If you choose to use Goggle Colab, you do not need to install Python and any other library in your machine. You will create you .ipynb file and run it using Google's GPU. 

If you have any questions, please post them on the Sakai forum, or reach out to me if you need to schedule an appointment. You will find the slides used in the lab, scripts recordings in this folder. 

You have two options to open the .ipynb files on your computer.

Option 1: Locate the file in the Github repo, for example <i> Lab1_SimpleCalculation.ipynb </i>. Right-click on <i> Raw > Download Linked File As </i>. Save it on a local folder in your machine. Then, open jupyter notebook using your terminal (for Mac users) or Anaconda (for PC users) and, from the list of folders that appear on jupyer web application, find the folder were you saved the <i> .ipynb </i> file. After you locate the file, click on it to open. Remember that to run it locally you need to perform the installation steps from Python 101 files.

Option 2: If you use Colab you can open the file directly from Github. Go to "**https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb**". Select File > Open Notebook. In the pop-up window navigate to the GitHub tab and locate our repository "lmmlima/ENV716_EnergyModeling_F2021". All available .ipynb files should appear in the list. Choose the one you want to open. You can now run and make any changes to this file. Make sure you save the file and any changes to your google drive before closing it.
